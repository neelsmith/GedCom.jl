# Genealogies


A `Genealogy` object is a digital model of the information encoded in a GEDCOM data source. If you have a file following the GEDCOM 5 specification, you can read it with the `genealogy_g5` function.

```{julia}
f = joinpath(repo, "test", "data", "pres2020.ged")
using GedCom
gen = genealogy_g5(f)
```



## Look up basic objects by ID values


You can look up individuals, families and sources in a  `Genealogy` object by their ID value, and can find family relations among individuals.


```{julia}
lincoln = individual("@I317@", gen)
typeof(lincoln)
```

```{julia}
fam = family("@F173@", gen)
typeof(fam)
```

```{julia}
src = source("@S2@", gen)
typeof(src)
```
