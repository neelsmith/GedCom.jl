# Families

## The `FamilyUnit`

`Individual`s and `FamilyUnit`s associate an identifier with its related block of `GEDRecord`s.  Data in the associated records are accessible from a bunch of functions.


```{julia}
GedCom.husbandid(lincolnfamily)
```
```{julia}
GedCom.wifeid(lincolnfamily)
```
```{julia}
GedCom.childrenids(lincolnfamily)
```
```{julia}
GedCom.marriagedate(lincolnfamily)
```
```{julia}
GedCom.marriageplace(lincolnfamily)
```
```@example fams
GedCom.marriagelonlat(lincolnfamily)
```
