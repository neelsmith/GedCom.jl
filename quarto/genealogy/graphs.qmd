# Graphs (networks) of relations


Get a representation of the individuals in a `Genealogy` as a Julia `SimpleValueGraph`:

```{julia}
using GedCom
root = pwd() |> dirname |> dirname
f = joinpath(root, "test", "data", "pres2020.ged")
gen = genealogy_g5(f)
gengraph = genealogyGraph(gen)
```


Cycle through the vertices, and collect the name value together with the vertex index in a named tuple:

```{julia}
vlist = vertices(gengraph) |> collect
nameidx = map(vlist) do i
    (v = i, name = get_vertexval(gengraph, i, :name))
end
```
